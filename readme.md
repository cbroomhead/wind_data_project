## Project Introduction
This project aims to showcase my programming skills and refine my ability to work with messy and complex datasets. I demonstrate data manipulation and preperation skills for analysis, and the creation of visualizations for data exploration and story-telling. Various Python based tools, libraries, and methods are used throughout the different projects so I tried seperating each major area into different folders, each containing it's own jupyter notebook(s). 
So far, the major areas showcased are:
- Inferential Statistics and Probability
- Data Visualizations
Each notebook does have some Data Wrangling and Cleaning practices to prepare the data for analysis.

I chose to work with the United States Wind Turbine Data which features more than 64,000 entries. See more information about the dataset below. 


## Dataset

The USWTDB combines a 2014 USGS data set (48,956 wind turbines, including decommissioned and duplicate turbines) with a 2017 LBNL data set (43,827 wind turbines) and includes regular updates from AWEA’s WindIQ as well as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Digital Obstacle File (DOF) and Obstacle Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA). The USWTDB is updated as frequently as quarterly as new data become available and will lag installations by approximately one quarter.

All turbine points in the data set are visually verified using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop, and X/Y locations are manually moved to the base of the turbine with an estimated locational tolerance of 10 meters. Visual verification also enables identification and removal of duplicate turbine points and decommissioned turbines from the database, although some decommissioned turbines likely have not yet been identified and thus remain in the data set. Moreover, because of a lag in obtaining up-to-date aerial imagery, some turbine locations have not been visually verified.

Technical specifications for turbines are assigned based on turbine make and model as described in literature, specifications listed in the FAA DOF, and collected via AWEA, LBNL, and turbine manufacturer websites. Because some make and model information does not exist or is difficult to obtain, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications.

The uncertainties associated with location and attribute data quality are rated, and a confidence level is recorded. None of the data in the USWTDB are field verified.
