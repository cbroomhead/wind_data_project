## Project Introduction
This branch of the project aims to demonstrate some inferrential statistics and basic probability. The various methods used are single and multi variate regressions with quantitative and categorical data, and there is also a logistic regression performed using a categorical variable. 

--> Some improvements need to be made to organize the notebook.
